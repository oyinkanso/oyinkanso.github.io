    <h2>Oyinkan and Adesola's Quarantine Time Capsule.</h2>
    <p>Hello. Today is Monday 20th April, 2020. This is a <span>time capsule</span>. It is a record of who we are right now. It is a record of a time when the <span>coronavirus</span> came. When all the <span>schools shut down</span>. And everyone got told to stay inside. We are group of <span>teenagers</span> sitting in our bedrooms. In our living rooms. Our kitchens. Staying in our homes in a town called Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire, England, Europe. In the World. For the next few weeks, or months - <span>no one knows how long</span>, really - We are not going anywhere. So we are going to <span>film ourselves</span>. Every week. So that we will remember what it was like. What we did... What we didn't do... And how we felt. Because this has never happened before. And it might never happen again. This is our Coronavirus Time Capsule. And it starts...<br><span><strong>Now</strong></span>.</p>
